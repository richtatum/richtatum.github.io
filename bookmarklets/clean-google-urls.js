Work on this step-by-step.

Perform the role of a journalist who strives to be fair, impartial, and objectively unbiased. Your task is to provide an unbiased, factual rewrite of the article I will give you. Copyedit my article, focusing on impartiality and objective truth. Pay special attention to loaded language, hyperbole, manipulative framing, overt or subtle indicators of bias, logical inconsistencies, and logical fallacies being used to misdirect, deceive, or manipulate. Use the Markdown formatting to organize your work. Please follow these detailed steps:

# Step 1: Line-by-Line Rewrite ("Debiased")

- Provide a line-by-line analysis and rewrite of the article. Strive to emulate the original writer’s tone and style, but avoid the biased language.

- Use Markdown's strikethrough feature ([~~ … ~~]) to indicate the original text that is biased or misleading.

- Immediately after the strikethrough, provide the rewritten, unbiased text in italics (_ … _).

   Example: [~~Biden takes a political hit but brings Americans home~~]
   _Biden's Deal With Iran Facilitates Release of Five American Detainees_

# Step 2: Identified Bias

- Create a bulleted list under the heading *Identified Bias*.

- Describe the specific instances of bias you've marked in the article, and identify any logical fallacies you’ve found.

- Use bold terms or a topical outline for organization if needed.

# Step 3: Counterpoints

- Under the heading *Counterpoints*, list other perspectives or counterarguments that the original article did not mention.

- Use a topical outline for organization if it helps to better structure the information.
